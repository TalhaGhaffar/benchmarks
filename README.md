## Installation
This workload suite is merely a collection of open source NodeJS applications with some wrapper scripts. There is no installation action needed to use the wrapper scripts except Python 2.7 is a prerequisite. However, to run each individual application, please take a look at their corresponding directories and following the corresponding installation steps closely.

## Basic Usage
